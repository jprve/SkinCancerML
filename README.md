# Melanoma Skin Cancer ML
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
This project is made in aim to take in various images of skin conditions and detect wether or not it is cancerous (melanoma) the dataset used in this project is provided by International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)


## Conclusions
- Adding samples to the dataset via augmentation significantly improved validation accuracy
- Increasing epochs also allowed the neural network to develop for longer thus in turn increasing accuracy
- Seborrheic Keratosis was the smallest sample
- Pigmented Benign Keratosis was the largest sample


## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- MatPlotLib
- Augmentor
- Google CoLab
- Pandas
- Numpy
